parallelism - the parallelism level
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException - if parallelism less than or equal to zero, or greater than implementation limit
SecurityException - if a security manager exists and the caller is not permitted to modify threads because it does not hold RuntimePermission("modifyThread")
ForkJoinPool
public ForkJoinPool(int parallelism,
                    ForkJoinPool.ForkJoinWorkerThreadFactory factory,
                    Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler handler,
                    boolean asyncMode)
Creates a ForkJoinPool with the given parameters.
Parameters:
parallelism - the parallelism level. For default value, use Runtime.availableProcessors().
factory - the factory for creating new threads. For default value, use defaultForkJoinWorkerThreadFactory.
handler - the handler for internal worker threads that terminate due to unrecoverable errors encountered while executing tasks. For default value, use null.
asyncMode - if true, establishes local first-in-first-out scheduling mode for forked tasks that are never joined. This mode may be more appropriate than default locally stack-based mode in applications in which worker threads only process event-style asynchronous tasks. For default value, use false.
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException - if parallelism less than or equal to zero, or greater than implementation limit
NullPointerException - if the factory is null
SecurityException - if a security manager exists and the caller is not permitted to modify threads because it does not hold RuntimePermission("modifyThread")
Method Detail
commonPool
public static ForkJoinPool commonPool()
Returns the common pool instance. This pool is statically constructed; its run state is unaffected by attempts to shutdown() or shutdownNow(). However this pool and any ongoing processing are automatically terminated upon program System.exit(int). Any program that relies on asynchronous task processing to complete before program termination should invoke commonPool().awaitQuiescence, before exit.
Returns:
the common pool instance
Since:
1.8
invoke
public <T> T invoke(ForkJoinTask<T> task)
Performs the given task, returning its result upon completion. If the computation encounters an unchecked Exception or Error, it is rethrown as the outcome of this invocation. Rethrown exceptions behave in the same way as regular exceptions, but, when possible, contain stack traces (as displayed for example using ex.printStackTrace()) of both the current thread as well as the thread actually encountering the exception; minimally only the latter.
Type Parameters:
T - the type of the task's result
Parameters:
task - the task
Returns:
the task's result
Throws:
NullPointerException - if the task is null
RejectedExecutionException - if the task cannot be scheduled for execution
execute
public void execute(ForkJoinTask<?> task)
Arranges for (asynchronous) execution of the given task.
Parameters:
task - the task
Throws:
NullPointerException - if the task is null
RejectedExecutionException - if the task cannot be scheduled for execution
execute
public void execute(Runnable task)
Description copied from interface: Executor
Executes the given command at some time in the future. The command may execute in a new thread, in a pooled thread, or in the calling thread, at the discretion of the Executor implementation.
Parameters:
task - the runnable task
Throws:
NullPointerException - if the task is null
RejectedExecutionException - if the task cannot be scheduled for execution
submit
public <T> ForkJoinTask<T> submit(ForkJoinTask<T> task)
Submits a ForkJoinTask for execution.
Type Parameters:
T - the type of the task's result
Parameters:
task - the task to submit
Returns:
the task
Throws:
NullPointerException - if the task is null
RejectedExecutionException - if the task cannot be scheduled for execution
submit
public <T> ForkJoinTask<T> submit(Callable<T> task)
Description copied from interface: ExecutorService
Submits a value-returning task for execution and returns a Future representing the pending results of the task. The Future's get method will return the task's result upon successful completion.
If you would like to immediately block waiting for a task, you can use constructions of the form result = exec.submit(aCallable).get();

Note: The Executors class includes a set of methods that can convert some other common closure-like objects, for example, PrivilegedAction to Callable form so they can be submitted.

Specified by:
submit in interface ExecutorService
Overrides:
submit in class AbstractExecutorService
Type Parameters:
T - the type of the task's result
Parameters:
task - the task to submit
Returns:
a Future representing pending completion of the task
Throws:
NullPointerException - if the task is null
RejectedExecutionException - if the task cannot be scheduled for execution
submit
public <T> ForkJoinTask<T> submit(Runnable task,
                                  T result)
Description copied from interface: ExecutorService
Submits a Runnable task for execution and returns a Future representing that task. The Future's get method will return the given result upon successful completion.
Specified by:
submit in interface ExecutorService
Overrides:
submit in class AbstractExecutorService
Type Parameters:
T - the type of the result
Parameters:
task - the task to submit

NullPointerException - if the task is null
RejectedExecutionException - if the task cannot be scheduled for execution
submit
public ForkJoinTask<?> submit(Runnable task)
Description copied from interface: ExecutorService
Submits a Runnable task for execution and returns a Future representing that task. The Future's get method will return null upon successful completion.
Specified by:
submit in interface ExecutorService
Overrides:
submit in class AbstractExecutorService
Parameters:
task - the task to submit
Returns:
a Future representing pending completion of the task
Throws:
NullPointerException - if the task is null
RejectedExecutionException - if the task cannot be scheduled for execution
invokeAll
public <T> List<Future<T>> invokeAll(Collection<? extends Callable<T>> tasks)
Description copied from interface: ExecutorService
Executes the given tasks, returning a list of Futures holding their status and results when all complete. Future.isDone() is true for each element of the returned list. Note that a completed task could have terminated either normally or by throwing an exception. The results of this method are undefined if the given collection is modified while this operation is in progress.
Specified by:
invokeAll in interface ExecutorService
Overrides:
invokeAll in class AbstractExecutorService
Type Parameters:
T - the type of the values returned from the tasks
Parameters:
tasks - the collection of tasks
Returns:
a list of Futures representing the tasks, in the same sequential order as produced by the iterator for the given task list, each of which has completed
Throws:
NullPointerException - if tasks or any of its elements are null
RejectedExecutionException - if any task cannot be scheduled for execution
getFactory
public ForkJoinPool.ForkJoinWorkerThreadFactory getFactory()
Returns the factory used for constructing new workers.
Returns:
the factory used for constructing new workers
getUncaughtExceptionHandler
public Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler getUncaughtExceptionHandler()
Returns the handler for internal worker threads that terminate due to unrecoverable errors encountered while executing tasks.
Returns:
the handler, or null if none
getParallelism
public int getParallelism()
Returns the targeted parallelism level of this pool.
Returns:
the targeted parallelism level of this pool
getCommonPoolParallelism
public static int getCommonPoolParallelism()
Returns the targeted parallelism level of the common pool.
Returns:
the targeted parallelism level of the common pool
Since:
1.8
getPoolSize
public int getPoolSize()
Returns the number of worker threads that have started but not yet terminated. The result returned by this method may differ from getParallelism() when threads are created to maintain parallelism when others are cooperatively blocked.
Returns:
the number of worker threads
getAsyncMode
public boolean getAsyncMode()
Returns true if this pool uses local first-in-first-out scheduling mode for forked tasks that are never joined.
Returns:
true if this pool uses async mode
getRunningThreadCount
public int getRunningThreadCount()
Returns an estimate of the number of worker threads that are not blocked waiting to join tasks or for other managed synchronization. This method may overestimate the number of running threads.
Returns:
the number of worker threads
getActiveThreadCount
public int getActiveThreadCount()
Returns an estimate of the number of threads that are currently stealing or executing tasks. This method may overestimate the number of active threads.
Returns:
the number of active threads
isQuiescent
public boolean isQuiescent()
Returns true if all worker threads are currently idle. An idle worker is one that cannot obtain a task to execute because none are available to steal from other threads, and there are no pending submissions to the pool. This method is conservative; it might not return true immediately upon idleness of all threads, but will eventually become true if threads remain inactive.
Returns:
true if all threads are currently idle
getStealCount
public long getStealCount()
Returns an estimate of the total number of tasks stolen from one thread's work queue by another. The reported value underestimates the actual total number of steals when the pool is not quiescent. This value may be useful for monitoring and tuning fork/join programs: in general, steal counts should be high enough to keep threads busy, but low enough to avoid overhead and contention across threads.
Returns:
the number of steals
getQueuedTaskCount
public long getQueuedTaskCount()
Returns an estimate of the total number of tasks currently held in queues by worker threads (but not including tasks submitted to the pool that have not begun executing). This value is only an approximation, obtained by iterating across all threads in the pool. This method may be useful for tuning task granularities.
Returns:
the number of queued tasks
getQueuedSubmissionCount
public int getQueuedSubmissionCount()
Returns an estimate of the number of tasks submitted to this pool that have not yet begun executing. This method may take time proportional to the number of submissions.
Returns:
the number of queued submissions
hasQueuedSubmissions
public boolean hasQueuedSubmissions()
Returns true if there are any tasks submitted to this pool that have not yet begun executing.
Returns:
true if there are any queued submissions
pollSubmission
protected ForkJoinTask<?> pollSubmission()
Removes and returns the next unexecuted submission if one is available. This method may be useful in extensions to this class that re-assign work in systems with multiple pools.
Returns:
the next submission, or null if none
drainTasksTo
protected int drainTasksTo(Collection<? super ForkJoinTask<?>> c)
Removes all available unexecuted submitted and forked tasks from scheduling queues and adds them to the given collection, without altering their execution status. These may include artificially generated or wrapped tasks. This method is designed to be invoked only when the pool is known to be quiescent. Invocations at other times may not remove all tasks. A failure encountered while attempting to add elements to collection c may result in elements being in neither, either or both collections when the associated exception is thrown. The behavior of this operation is undefined if the specified collection is modified while the operation is in progress.
Parameters:
c - the collection to transfer elements into
Returns:
the number of elements transferred
toString
public String toString()
Returns a string identifying this pool, as well as its state, including indications of run state, parallelism level, and worker and task counts.
Overrides:
toString in class Object
Returns:
a string identifying this pool, as well as its state
shutdown
public void shutdown()
Possibly initiates an orderly shutdown in which previously submitted tasks are executed, but no new tasks will be accepted. Invocation has no effect on execution state if this is the commonPool(), and no additional effect if already shut down. Tasks that are in the process of being submitted concurrently during the course of this method may or may not be rejected.
Throws:
SecurityException - if a security manager exists and the caller is not permitted to modify threads because it does not hold RuntimePermission("modifyThread")
shutdownNow
public List<Runnable> shutdownNow()
Possibly attempts to cancel and/or stop all tasks, and reject all subsequently submitted tasks. Invocation has no effect on execution state if this is the commonPool(), and no additional effect if already shut down. Otherwise, tasks that are in the process of being submitted or executed concurrently during the course of this method may or may not be rejected. This method cancels both existing and unexecuted tasks, in order to permit termination in the presence of task dependencies. So the method always returns an empty list (unlike the case for some other Executors).
Returns:
an empty list
Throws:
SecurityException - if a security manager exists and the caller is not permitted to modify threads because it does not hold RuntimePermission("modifyThread")
isTerminated
public boolean isTerminated()
Returns true if all tasks have completed following shut down.
Returns:
true if all tasks have completed following shut down
isTerminating
public boolean isTerminating()
Returns true if the process of termination has commenced but not yet completed. This method may be useful for debugging. A return of true reported a sufficient period after shutdown may indicate that submitted tasks have ignored or suppressed interruption, or are waiting for I/O, causing this executor not to properly terminate. (See the advisory notes for class ForkJoinTask stating that tasks should not normally entail blocking operations. But if they do, they must abort them on interrupt.)
Returns:
true if terminating but not yet terminated
isShutdown
public boolean isShutdown()
Returns true if this pool has been shut down.
Returns:
true if this pool has been shut down
awaitTermination
public boolean awaitTermination(long timeout,
                                TimeUnit unit)
                         throws InterruptedException
Blocks until all tasks have completed execution after a shutdown request, or the timeout occurs, or the current thread is interrupted, whichever happens first. Because the commonPool() never terminates until program shutdown, when applied to the common pool, this method is equivalent to awaitQuiescence(long, TimeUnit) but always returns false.
Parameters:
timeout - the maximum time to wait
unit - the time unit of the timeout argument
Returns:
true if this executor terminated and false if the timeout elapsed before termination
Throws:
InterruptedException - if interrupted while waiting
awaitQuiescence
public boolean awaitQuiescence(long timeout,
                               TimeUnit unit)
If called by a ForkJoinTask operating in this pool, equivalent in effect to ForkJoinTask.helpQuiesce(). Otherwise, waits and/or attempts to assist performing tasks until this pool isQuiescent() or the indicated timeout elapses.
Parameters:
timeout - the maximum time to wait
unit - the time unit of the timeout argument
Returns:
true if quiescent; false if the timeout elapsed.
managedBlock
public static void managedBlock(ForkJoinPool.ManagedBlocker blocker)
                         throws InterruptedException
Runs the given possibly blocking task. When running in a ForkJoinPool, this method possibly arranges for a spare thread to be activated if necessary to ensure sufficient parallelism while the current thread is blocked in blocker.block().
This method repeatedly calls blocker.isReleasable() and blocker.block() until either method returns true. Every call to blocker.block() is preceded by a call to blocker.isReleasable() that returned false.

If not running in a ForkJoinPool, this method is behaviorally equivalent to

 
 while (!blocker.isReleasable())
   if (blocker.block())
     break;
If running in a ForkJoinPool, the pool may first be expanded to ensure sufficient parallelism available during the call to blocker.block().
Parameters:
blocker - the blocker task
Throws:
InterruptedException - if blocker.block() did so
newTaskFor
protected <T> RunnableFuture<T> newTaskFor(Runnable runnable,
                                           T value)
Description copied from class: AbstractExecutorService
Returns a RunnableFuture for the given runnable and default value.
Overrides:
newTaskFor in class AbstractExecutorService
Type Parameters:
T - the type of the given value
Parameters:
runnable - the runnable task being wrapped
value - the default value for the returned future
Returns:
a RunnableFuture which, when run, will run the underlying runnable and which, as a Future, will yield the given value as its result and provide for cancellation of the underlying task
newTaskFor
protected <T> RunnableFuture<T> newTaskFor(Callable<T> callable)
Description copied from class: AbstractExecutorService
Returns a RunnableFuture for the given callable task.
Overrides:
newTaskFor in class AbstractExecutorService
Type Parameters:
T - the type of the callable's result
Parameters:
callable - the callable task being wrapped
Returns:
a RunnableFuture which, when run, will call the underlying callable and which, as a Future, will yield the callable's result as its result and provide for cancellation of the underlying task
